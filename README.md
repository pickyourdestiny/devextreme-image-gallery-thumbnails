# Devextreme Image Gallery Plus Thumbnail Viewer

I bumped into this solution because I was trying to reduce the number of external libraries in another project and only use Devextreme.

You are probably already aware of the Devextreme Gallery widget.  This solution combines the Gallery widget and the Tab widget, however the Tab widget is repurposed as a thumbnail slider.

The Tab widget was recently improved and now has an orientation option that can be horizontal or vertical, which provides a more flexible thumbnail slider depending on your use case (or allow the user to switch between the two as shown in this demo and the code provided)
