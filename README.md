# Purpose

I bumped into this solution because I was trying to reduce the number of external libraries in another project and only use Devextreme.

Originally I used another external library that combined an image gallery with a thumbnail viewer, but I wasn't happy with the results because it didn't have the professional look and feel Devextreme consistently delivers.

So I combined the Devextreme Gallery Widget with the Tab Widget, which now has the option of having a vertical orientation. I repurposed the tab widget as a thumbnail viewer using the built-in item render capability.
