# Devextreme Image Gallery + Thumbnail Slider

I ran into this solution because I was trying to reduce the number of external libraries in another project and only use Devextreme.

You may already be aware of the Devextreme Gallery widget. This solution combines the Gallery widget and the Tabs widget, however the Tabs widget is re-purposed as a thumbnail slider.

The Tabs widget was recently improved (https://js.devexpress.com/React/New/23_2/#Tabs-and-TabPanel) and now has an orientation option that allows you to align the tabs horizontally or vertically, which provides a more flexible thumbnail slider depending on your use case.

Alternatively, you can allow the user to switch between the two thumbnail orientations as shown in this demo and the code provided.

Note: The vertical thumbnail orientation has the added bonus of allowing users to scroll up and down through the thumbnail list (using your mouse wheel) instead of having to rely on the tabs navigation buttons alone
