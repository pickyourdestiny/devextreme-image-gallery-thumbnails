# Devextreme Image Gallery Plus Thumbnail Viewer

I bumped into this solution because I was trying to reduce the number of external libraries in another project and only use Devextreme.

You are probably already aware of the Devextreme Gallery widget.  This solution combines the Gallery widget and the Tab widget, however the Tab widget is repurposed as a thumbnail slider.

The Tab widget now has the feature of having both a horizontal or vertical orientation, which provides a more flexible image thumbnail viewer depending on your use case (or allow the user to switch modes as shown in this demo)
